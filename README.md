## Keep-Mini
### My version of Google Keep

Name: [Lena Last](linkedin.com/in/lena-last)

Education: JavaScript Developer at Jensen Education


This is a school project and my idea was to recreate Google Keep but in a smaller version.
The functionalities are basic to make a list of to-dos. I also have some more fun functionalities like the different 
background colors on the list cards (like Google Keep has) and avatars to choose from, which has a Pok√©mon theme. 

Go and test it out [here](http://207.154.198.252/)
