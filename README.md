Education: JavaScript Developer at Jensen Education


This is a school project and my idéa was to recreate Google Keep, but in a smaller version.
The functionalities are basic to make a list of todos. But I also have a bit more fun functionalities like the different 
background colors on the list cards (like Google Keep have) and avatars to choose from, with Pokémon theme.
